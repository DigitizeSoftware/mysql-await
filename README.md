# mysql-await

A wrapper over [mysqljs/mysql](https://github.com/mysqljs/mysql) module that mimics the same API as the original one but takes advantage of
promises.

This is just a placeholder repo as of now. I'll be adding some description while porting functionality from my other project to this repo.
Stay tuned :).
